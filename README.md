# **The Odin Project =>** *Drag-A-Doodle* (Etch-A-Sketch)
*Drag - A - Doodle* is my take on the classic *Etch-A-Sketch* drawing game. The player should be able to set a grid/pixel size for the drawing board, draw and erase with the mouse, pick and change colours as well as reset the board once done. 

This challenge is part of The Odin Projects foundation course, it gives basic prompts on what to do but leaves how to implement your ideas completely open and as such is a daunting task to a beginner. 


I have made the game as responsive to screen size as possible but best displayed and played on a computer rather than tablet or mobile as I could not get the pointer events to work as well as the current mouse events.
